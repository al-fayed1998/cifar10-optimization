# CIFAR-10 Model Improvements

## Context
This project was carried out to demonstrate our understanding of the concepts taught in the computer vision course. The primary objective is to manipulate various parameters of a model from scratch, perform fine-tuning, and extract features.

## Objective
The objective of this practical work is to show that we have truly understood the concepts taught in the course and can manipulate different parameters of a model from scratch, perform fine-tuning, or feature extraction.

## Methodology
In this exercise, we will:
1. Execute the professor's code and observe the result.
2. Improve the professor's code by modifying certain parameters and observe the results.

### Professor's Code
The professor's model achieves a validation accuracy of 61.19% after 20 epochs with a validation loss of 1.0925. Although this model is relatively simple and quick to train, it suffers from underfitting and does not use advanced regularization or optimization techniques.

### Proposed Improvements
In this section, we propose two types of improvements to demonstrate that we have thoroughly understood the concepts taught. The objective of this practical work is not only to present the results but also to interpret them and show that we have mastered the concepts provided by the professor.

## Results
We will present the results in two ways:
1. The raw result.
2. The improvement of the raw result.

In the final results table, as required by the professor, we will include only the best results.

## Conclusion
At the end of all the code, we will present a results table to the professor with all the scenarios. This will demonstrate our understanding and mastery of the concepts taught in the course.
